Tracks how fresh your WordPress posts are and highlights stale content in both frontend and admin dashboard.

== Description ==
Fresh Reminder helps you monitor how fresh your posts are and when they need updating.  
It automatically calculates the age of your posts based on the last modified date and marks them as:

- Reviewed – Manually confirmed as up to date.   
- Unreviwed – Not updated for a long time and requires attention.  

The plugin adds a dashboard page showing all your posts sorted by freshness, so you can easily identify which content needs updates.  

Ideal for bloggers, SEO specialists, and content managers who want to maintain up-to-date content and improve their website’s search performance.

== Features ==
* Automatic content freshness indicator on posts.  
* Custom admin dashboard listing all posts with freshness status.  
* Filter posts by category, status, or keyword.  
* Built-in search for quick access to specific posts.  
* Pin to CheckBucket — temporarily save posts that need manual review.  
* CheckBucket section to manage pinned posts.  
* Plugin Settings Page to customize freshness thresholds (e.g., 15/60/120 days).  
* AJAX-powered dashboard for smooth interactions without page reloads.  
* Optimized caching for improved performance.  
* Lightweight and secure — no external API calls.  
* Works immediately after activation.
