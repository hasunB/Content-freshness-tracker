## Fresh Reminder

A lightweight WordPress plugin that tracks how fresh your posts are and highlights **stale content** in both the frontend and WordPress Admin Dashboard.  

Stay on top of your content updates and keep your site relevant for readers and search engines.
<br>

## Features
- **Content Freshness Tracking**: The plugin tracks the last updated date of your posts to determine their **freshness.** 

- **Status Indicators**: It assigns a status to each post, which is visible in the admin dashboard and on the post itself (as a widget). The primary statuses are: 
  - 🟢 **Reviewd** (Already Reviewed)    
  - 🔴 **Unreviewed** (not updated for given months)  
- Click-to-edit links directly from the dashboard.

- **Dashboard Overview**
  - Displays a complete overview of all posts and their freshness status.
  - Allows quick post editing and updating directly from the dashboard.
  - Dynamic refresh ensures real-time updates after any change.

- **Frontend Widget**: A widget is displayed on the frontend of your site, showing the freshness status of each post to your visitors.

- **Settings Page**: The plugin includes a settings page where you can customize the "unreviewed" threshold (e.g., how many months without an update until a post is marked as unreviewed).

- **Category & Status Filtering**
  - Admins can filter posts by:
  - Post category (e.g., News, Guides, Tutorials).
  - Freshness status (Stale, Reviewed, Unreviwed).
  - Helps quickly isolate content needing updates in specific topics.

- **Search Function**
  - Built-in search bar for quickly locating posts by title, category, or tag.
  - Supports AJAX live search for instant results.

- **Pin to “CheckBucket”**
  - Users can pin specific posts that need manual review or extra attention.
  - Pinned posts are stored in a special collection called the “CheckBucket.”
  - The CheckBucket acts like a temporary bin — perfect for managing content you want to recheck later.
  - Posts can be easily added or removed from the CheckBucket with one click.

- Works out-of-the-box, **no setup required**.
